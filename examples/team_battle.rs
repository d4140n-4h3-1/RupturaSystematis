//! Team battle: red droids against cyan droids in the combat arena, `data/arena/combat_map.glb`.
//!
//! Five a side, all played by the AI, each one of the game's own droids (see
//! `maze::player::avatar`): red in the hostile droid's colours, `data/droid_hostile.glb`, and cyan
//! in the full deform droid's, `data/droid_full_deform.glb`, with every one of the game's droid's
//! animations: walking with no enemy about, jogging to one, running for cover and sprinting when
//! falling back hurt - skidding as they stop and turn - strafing and crouch-strafing while they
//! face a target, a jump now and then as they break for cover, the pistol drawn, raised, aimed up,
//! down and to the side at the target and fired - a glowing green bolt from its muzzle, the
//! game's own (see `maze::player::pistol`), which does its harm when it gets there - and
//! holstered once the fighting is over. Shot
//! down, a droid falls limp, knocked back by the shot, and may lose what it was hit in; it comes
//! back as a new droid. They cross the arena along the walk grid, see only in front
//! of them (hydroxus-ai's sight), and fight from cover: a crouched droid behind a low block is out
//! of the line of fire, and stands up to shoot over it; behind a wall or a pillar too tall to shoot
//! over, it stands with its back to it, as the player does in cover, and leans out round the side
//! of it to shoot. Hurt, a droid
//! falls back to cover further from the enemy. The dead come back at their own end of the arena
//! a few seconds later, and the first team to reach the kill limit wins the match.
//!
//! Each side fights as a team: it picks its targets - whoever is shooting at it, hurt, or out in
//! the open before whoever is merely nearest - takes cover from every enemy it knows of, not
//! just one, keeps out of sight of them as it moves and spreads out, sends some of its droids
//! round the side, leaves cover only while a teammate is firing, and fires at where an enemy
//! was just seen to keep their head down; a droid shot at like that stays down a moment.
//! `BATTLE_OLD=red` (or `cyan`, or `both`) has that side fight as they did before all that, one
//! droid at a time, to see the difference: each match ends by saying which side won.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run --example team_battle`. `BATTLE_MAP=<path>` fights in another arena, such
//! as the capture-the-flag map, `data/arena/ctf_map.glb`: the teams start at its two ends along x.
//!
//! The camera is free: WASD to fly, Q and E down and up, Shift to go faster, the right mouse
//! button held to look round. Tab follows the next droid, F lets it go, Space pauses, R starts a
//! new match, Escape quits.
