//! Credits, the maze's money: whole credits and hundredths of one, as dollars and cents are, kept

//! Every computer carries some, whatever else it has on it - a random amount, most of them a few
//! credits and now and then a good deal more (see [`Credits::random`]) - which clearing its hack
//! transfers to the player (see [`crate::computer`]). A store's till keeps more, and a bank's
//! computers a great deal more (see [`Credits::store`] and [`Credits::bank`]).
