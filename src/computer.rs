//! A computer in the maze to hack, as in Welcome to the Game: walk up to it and press E, and the
//! view goes in close on its screen, where a terminal in green text asks for a breach. Each
//! breach is a run of commands to type, one at a time, each against the clock of a trace: typed
//! out exactly before the trace completes, the next comes up; a wrong key does not go in, and
//! costs the trace time. Six typed, access is granted. If the trace completes first, access is
//! denied, and Enter starts again at once. Tab walks away.
//!
//! The monitor's frame glows red while the computer is locked and blue once it is cleared. For
//! now it only stands near where the player starts, to try the hacking out; it opens nothing.
//!
//! The terminal is on the screen itself while the player uses the computer: an interface of its
//! own, in DejaVu Sans Mono, drawn into a texture the screen glows with. The engine leaves such a
//! texture blank if the scene looks for it before the interface has first drawn into it, so each
//! use gets a fresh texture, and the screen only takes it up once the interface has drawn into it
//! ([`ScreenTerminal`]). Otherwise the screen just glows a faint green. With
//! MAZE_TERMINAL_OVERLAY=1 the terminal comes up over the screen instead, as a panel of the
//! game's own interface, as big as the screen is in the view.
//!
//! Every computer carries credits too, a random amount whatever its files are (see
//! [`crate::credits`]); clearing it transfers them to the player, and the terminal says how many.
//! A city's stores and banks have computers of their own ([`Kind`]): a store's keeps more, and
//! each of a bank's several far more, behind a longer breach against a faster trace. One of a
//! bank's opens its vault: cleared, its listing starts with OPEN VAULT (see [`crate::vault`]).
//!
//! Once cleared, the computer's files are open to read: notes and diary entries, shared out among
//! the maze's computers (see [`crate::notes`]). Up and down pick one, Enter opens it, up and down
//! scroll it and Backspace goes back to the listing.
//!
//! Every key beeps from the screen, made from the formants in [`COMPUTER_SOUNDS`]: lightly for
//! one that goes in, low and buzzing for one that does not, twice rising for a command typed out.
