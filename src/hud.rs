//! What is written on screen: a status line in the corner, a banner across the middle for the
//! end of a round and for anything that went wrong, the droids' alert at the top in the middle,
//! as in Metal Gear and Fallout, the player's stamina in the bottom left corner, and, with the
//! pistol out, its ammo in the bottom right: the cyber pistol's is endless, shown as ∞. The
//! player's credits are in the top right.
//!
//! The alert is coloured by its phase - ALERT red, EVASION amber, CAUTION yellow - and ALERT and
//! CAUTION blink; EVASION and CAUTION count down the seconds they have left. The player's health
//! is a red bar in the bottom middle, and the screen flashes red as they are hit; while their
//! shield is up (see [`crate::shield`]) the same bar is the shield's, blue, named SHIELD ACTIVE. The stamina is a bar,
//! green, yellow once it runs low, and red and blinking while the player is winded. Sentries have
//! bars like these over their heads, their health above their stamina, and the drone its health
//! (see [`Hud::show_overhead_bars`]).
