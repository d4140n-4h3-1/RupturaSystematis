//! Finding the walkable ground of a level that is already in the scene.
//!
//! This is the scene side of [`layout`](crate::layout): it samples the level's colliders on a
//! grid of cells, and turns cells back into places in the world.
//!
//! A cell's floor is the highest in it with headroom over it, under a ceiling, and room around:
//! the ground, or a stair, or a floor up above. A cell holds one floor, so ground under a floor
//! up above is left out. A level out in the open, with no ceiling over it, has the sky for its
//! ceiling: a cell's floor there is the first surface down. Of those, the walkable cells are the ground and whatever can be climbed
//! to from it a stair's step at a time ([`hydroxus_ai::grid::MAX_CLIMB`]) - not the tops of
//! crates or walls, which no stairs lead up to.
