//! A droid gone limp: its body falls as the physics has it, one rigid body for each part of it.
//!
//! [`MOTION`]'s `ragdoll` has the parts, made along with the droid's animations: eighteen bodies -
//! pelvis, abdomen, chest, head, and each side's collarbone, upper arm, forearm, hand, thigh, shin
//! and foot - each driving one bone, with capsules and boxes fitted to the droid's skin, joined by
//! ball joints limited to how far a body bends, and every pose in the animations. Each body sits
//! exactly where its bone does, so a body's pose is its bone's; the bones in between, the fingers
//! and toes ride along as they were.
//!
//! Going limp takes two steps. The joints' frames are fixed by where the engine finds the joint
//! and the two bodies the first time it sees them, so the bodies are first laid out as the droid
//! stands in its rest pose - out of the way, touching nothing, not moving - long enough for the
//! engine to join them ([`BIND_FRAMES`]). Then each is put where its bone is in whatever the droid
//! was doing, carrying on as fast as the droid was going, the bolt that stopped it knocking it
//! back, and let go. From then on the bones follow the bodies.
//!
//! The bodies bump into the maze and into each other, but not into anyone's capsule: the player
//! and the droids walk through someone lying on the floor rather than climb over them. Bolts hit
//! them, and shove them.
