//! Hearts: health items floating in the maze's corridors, each slowly spinning and bobbing up and
//! down. Walking into one with health to make up picks it up (see [`Hearts::take`]), and gives
//! back a good part of it at once (see [`crate::health`]).
//!
//! The model, [`HEART_MODEL`], is made in Blender from `health.blend` and exported as it is; it
//! is scaled here to [`SIZE`] however big it was made. The engine takes a glTF model's surfaces
//! for solid whatever their alpha, so a see-through one - the heart's outer layer - is made glass
//! here, of its own colour ([`Hearts::glaze`]), as the ceiling's panes are.
//!
//! As it glows, each lights what is round it too, red, from a lamp in its middle, whose shadows
//! are traced as every light's are. The heart itself casts none, or it would shut its own light
//! in.
//!
//! A few are scattered afresh each maze ([`count`]), each on open floor away from the start and
//! from the others ([`spots`]) - the first a little way from the start, so there is one to come
//! across early.
//!
//! Shield cells - spare charges for the shield (see [`crate::shield`]) - float about the same
//! way, from their own model, [`SHIELD_PICKUP_MODEL`], made in Blender from `shield.blend`, with
//! a blue lamp. They are rarer: about one for every three hearts ([`shield_count`]).
