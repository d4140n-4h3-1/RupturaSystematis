//! Talking to the maze's inhabitants, as in Fallout 3: E to talk to a droid close by and in
//! front of you, and the camera closes in on its face. What it says runs along the bottom of the
//! screen, in its own System Latin (see `data/system_latin/system_latin_systemized.md`) with
//! what that means under it, and under that the replies to pick from - with the mouse, W and S or
//! the arrows and E, or the number keys. Tab walks away.
//!
//! What each droid says is in `data/dialogue/droids.json`, whose `about` says what everything in
//! it means, and which can be rewritten without a rebuild. Each kind of droid has a
//! conversation of its own: lines, and the replies to each that lead on to other lines or end
//! it. A reply can be a skill check, `[Speech 40%]`, that goes one way if it succeeds and another
//! if it fails; a check is tried only once. A reply already given is shown dimmed.
//!
//! A check can also be tried with a bribe (see [`Bribe`]), offered under it as a reply of its own,
//! `[Speech 75%] [40.00 CR]`: the same check, more likely to succeed, for credits paid whether it
//! does or not. It is one try with the check: trying either takes both away. Without the credits
//! it is shown dimmed, and cannot be picked. Only droids that know something worth paying for
//! are offered bribes - not maintenance units, which do not know where the exit is - and drones
//! cannot be talked to at all.
//!
//! Each line has a mood, which colours the whole panel, and the droid's eyes: green as usual, blue
//! for success, yellow for a warning or a question, orange for agitation, red for hostility. A
//! line says its own, or takes one from how the check that led to it went: blue if it succeeded,
//! orange if not.
//!
//! A line can have the droid turn on the player once the conversation is over (see
//! [`Conversation::attacks`]): a sentry that sees through the player goes after them. A kind of
//! droid can also have [`Bark`]s, said out loud with nobody talking to it, as it hunts the
//! player: when it spots them, when it loses them, when it hears them, and when it gives up
//! looking.
//!
//! Every kind of droid can say how it takes having the pistol pointed at it ([`Threatened`]):
//! how long it will stand for it before warning the player, and what it does once it has warned
//! them twice - a sentry goes after them, anyone else sounds the alarm for the sentries.
//!
//! Lines can name what is true where the conversation happens, in braces: `{code}`, the droid's
//! code, and `{exit_far}` and `{exit_way}`, how far off the exit is and which way. Each is put in
//! System Latin where the droid says it, and in English where the meaning is given.
//!
//! [`screen`] draws it all.
