//! The conversation on screen, as in Fallout 3: a panel along the bottom, with who is talking,
//! what they say and what it means, how the last check went, and the replies to pick from, the
//! one picked lit up; and the hint to talk, under the middle of the screen, while there is
//! someone close enough. The panel is coloured by the mood of what is being said: green as
//! usual, blue, yellow, orange or red (see [`Mood`]). What is said, in System Latin, and what it
//! means, in English, can each be switched off in the options (see [`Subtitles`]); the English
//! alone is as big as the System Latin.
