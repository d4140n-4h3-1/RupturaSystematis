//! The player: a capsule-shaped rigid body with a camera at eye height.
//!
//! The player can stand, crouch or crawl. C goes between standing and crouching (and up from a
//! crawl to a crouch); Z goes between crawling and standing (and down from a crouch to a crawl).
//! Crouching and crawling shrink the body from the top, so the feet stay on the floor, and lower
//! the eyes with it.
//!
//! The player walks, jogs, runs or sprints. Caps Lock goes between walking and jogging, and a tap
//! of Shift between walking and running, each staying where it is put; Shift held down sprints
//! for as long as it is held, from any of them. Speed is not picked up or put
//! down at once: the body accelerates into it and slows out of it - see `ramp` in [`movement`] -
//! and off the ground there is barely anything to push against, so a jump mostly keeps the way it
//! was going.
//!
//! Space jumps: tapped, a low jump, and held, a high one. Each press jumps once.
//!
//! Tab takes cover against the wall ahead, and A and D slide along it to its edge - see
//! [`cover`].
//!
//! Holding the right mouse button strafes: the droid keeps facing ahead whichever way it goes -
//! see [`avatar`]. A run or a sprint slows to a jog while it does, and picks up again when it is
//! let go.
//!
//! R draws the pistol and holsters it again, and the left mouse button draws it and then fires
//! it - see [`pistol`]. What its bolts hit, the game hears of from [`Player::struck`].
//!
//! A run costs breath, and a sprint more of it: see [`Player::breathe`]. Out of breath, the player is
//! down to a walk until they have got some of it back.
//!
//! The head is not carried perfectly level. Seen through the droid's eyes, it rises and falls in
//! step with the stride; it dips as the knees take a landing, and rolls into sideways movement
//! and into turns.
//!
//! F switches the flashlight on and off; it starts off.
//!
//! Jogging, running, sprinting, landing hard and the pistol are heard: see [`noise`].
//!
//! What the player hears, they hear from where the camera is, facing the way it faces.
//!
//! In cover at the edge of the wall, holding the key that would go on past - or aiming the pistol -
//! leans: the head moves out round the corner and tilts, to see past it without stepping out from
//! behind it - see [`lean`]. It never leans into a wall.
//!
//! Holding Q looks behind: the head turns round over the shoulder while the body keeps going the
//! way it was facing, so the player can see what is following them without stopping.
//!
//! The player is seen from behind, as a droid (see [`avatar`]), with the camera held back over its
//! shoulder; V goes between that and seeing through its eyes, and holding the middle mouse button
//! swings the camera round it - see [`third_person`].
//!
//! Talking to another droid, the droid turns to face it and the camera closes in on its face -
//! see [`talk`].
//!
//! In first person, the pistol is held in view, as in Call of Duty - see [`viewmodel`].
//!
//! Each of these has a file of its own here, adding to [`Player`] what it needs.
