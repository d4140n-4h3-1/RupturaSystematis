//! The droid the player is seen as in third person, and the maze's inhabitants are too: its
//! model, and the cycles it walks, runs, sprints and crouches along with.
//!
//! The droid's feet set the pace. However a cycle was made - walking on the spot, or forward
//! through the scene - its hips go past whichever foot is planted on the floor as fast as the
//! droid goes when that foot stays put, and that is what each gait's speed is (see
//! [`Avatar::pace`]). At any speed along the way, speeding up or slowing down, a cycle is played
//! exactly as fast as the floor goes by under it. Any travel built into it is taken back out,
//! since the body does the moving.
//!
//! Each gait standing has a cycle of its own: walking, running with Caps Lock, sprinting with
//! Shift. Crouching and crawling share the crouch, played faster for the quicker gaits and slower
//! down on the floor. Standing still, the droid settles into its idle, or its rest pose if it has
//! none; crouched, it holds the crouch where it stopped. Going from one cycle to another, it
//! carries on at the same point in the stride, with the same foot down - whichever foot each
//! cycle starts on.
//!
//! The droid turns to face the way the keys held send it - ahead, to either side, back, or along
//! any of the diagonals between - turning the short way round; let go, it turns back to face
//! ahead. The camera and the body stay facing straight ahead.
//!
//! Strafing, with the right mouse button held or the pistol drawn, it keeps facing ahead instead,
//! its face and shoulders square to straight ahead however its hips turn, and steps whichever
//! way the body goes: forward, or sideways, back and along each diagonal in its strafes, walking,
//! jogging, running - the player's sprint slows to a run strafing - or crouched, crawling too. Whichever of those is nearest the way it is
//! going, it turns only by what is left over, a few degrees. Without a strafe back it plays its
//! cycle backwards, and without the others it turns as far as it has to, up to side on.
//!
//! On stairs, walking or running along them as it faces, it climbs or goes down them with its
//! cycles made on stairs: a step at a time walking, two at a time at any faster gait, and only as
//! fast as those go - a little faster hurrying. Each foot is still put down on the step under it,
//! by however far that is from the step the cycle had there, staying on it as the body is lifted
//! onto each step ahead of the feet; and the hips ride on the step under the lower foot - with the
//! cycle as it climbs, over a moment as the other foot's step takes over. Going over to them or back, the feet go by the steps under them in
//! the pose as far as it has gone over. Strafing any way but straight ahead, or crouched, it
//! takes stairs in its own cycles, each foot put down on its step all the same.
//!
//! Sprinting or running flat out, and only then, the droid skids, with the skids for that gait;
//! jogging, it just turns and slows down.
//! Turning round - from going forward to going back, say - it digs its feet in, slides, swings
//! round whichever way is shorter and runs out the other way through the run. Turning a quarter
//! of the way round, it cuts across. Letting go of the keys, it slides to a standstill and idles.
//! Whether it is sprinting goes by how fast it is going rather than the keys, so letting go of
//! Shift with the rest still stops out of the sprint, or the run.
//!
//! The skids are made on the spot; [`MOTION`] has where each takes the droid and how far round,
//! frame by frame. The skid carries the body along that path, as far as it goes for how fast
//! the droid went in, and swings the droid round with it. A turn hands back to the cycles as it
//! runs out, and a stop to the idle, which it ends on. Leaving the ground, crouching, strafing or
//! taking cover cuts a skid short, as does setting off again in a stop, and strafing or in cover
//! the droid never skids.
//!
//! Jumping, the droid pushes off, flies with its legs tucked and takes the landing in its knees,
//! standing or on the move as it is going at the time: from standing still it springs straight
//! up and lands on the spot, and on the move it leaps in its stride and lands running - with a
//! jump of its own for jogging, and another for running or sprinting. Every jump
//! starts as a high one, and turns into a low one if the jump is cut short. The push off starts
//! from its lowest point, since the body leaves the ground the moment the key goes down. Falling
//! off an edge it flies the same way, once it has been in the air long enough to be more than a
//! step down. It lands hard or lightly as it was falling fast or not.
//!
//! In cover against a wall, it leans back against it, GTA V style: its cover idle, and its cover
//! walk and jog, shuffling sideways along the wall with its back to it, in place of the usual
//! ones - each made twice, for the wall on its left and on its right. Without them it idles and
//! walks as ever. At the corner, where the wall ends, aiming - or pushing on past the corner -
//! turns it across the wall to lean out round it and aim one-handed, only as far out as it has to;
//! firing without aiming only reaches the pistol out round the corner in one hand, the droid
//! staying behind the wall.
//!
//! It draws a pistol, holds it at the ready, raises it to aim and fires it, lowers it again a
//! moment after the last shot unless it is held raised, and holsters it, with its upper body - from the
//! middle of its back up - while its legs go on walking, running, strafing or standing as ever.
//! At the ready, with the pistol held low in the right hand alone, the left arm is let go to
//! swing as the legs have it, pumping in step with a run, and takes hold again as the pistol
//! comes up. Running at the ready, its shoulders twist against its hips with each stride, the
//! pistol swaying only a little with them, and the pistol bobs, the muzzle dipping as each
//! landing drops the hips.
//! The pistol shows partway through the draw and goes again partway through the holster, as
//! [`MOTION`] says, and until then is out of sight in its right hand. Out, it follows the
//! camera: its upper body leans the pistol up, down and round towards wherever the camera looks,
//! as far as the model's aims go, by the aims [`MOTION`] lays out, blended and added on top of
//! whatever the pistol is doing. A shot leaves the muzzle
//! on the frame the model says, the way the barrel pointed as the trigger was pulled - before
//! the recoil kicks it up - for the body to send on its way: see [`Avatar::shot`]. The screen
//! on top of the pistol, see-through green glass with the crosshair on it, shows all the while
//! the pistol is out, and flashes brighter with each pull of the trigger. The
//! ball at the muzzle the shots come from - a glowing core in a see-through green shell - shows
//! all the while the pistol is out, the core and the shell tumbling every way round, each the
//! opposite way to the other.
//!
//! Its meshes cast shadows, traced as it is posed each frame. The player's own droid casts them
//! only while it is seen from outside (see [`Avatar::set_casts_shadows`]): seen through its
//! eyes, the flashlight is inside its head.
