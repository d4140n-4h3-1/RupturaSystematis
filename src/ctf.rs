//! Capture the flag: two sides, red and blue, each with a base round its flag at one end of the
//! map (see [`crate::firewall`]). The player is blue - [`PLAYERS`] - and takes red's flag.
//!
//! Each side has [`DROIDS`] droids and a drone of its own. Blue's are the player's allies:
//! they pay the player no heed, and go after red's. Red's guard their end, watching for the
//! player all the while, and go after the player or blue's, whichever they see. Of each side's
//! droids, each keeps to a post of its own in its side's half, as the map marks them; each
//! side's drone patrols round its own flag. A droid comes after one of the other side it sees
//! and shoots it with its pistol; a drone fires at them. Each side's shots harm only the other
//! side: red's harm the player too.
