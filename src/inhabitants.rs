//! The maze's inhabitants: droids like the player's, going about the maze by themselves.
//!
//! Each one wanders. It picks somewhere a good walk away, follows the cheapest route there over
//! the survey's grid - which keeps to the middle of the corridors (see
//! [`WalkGrid::routes_from`]) - and when it gets there stands idling a while before setting off
//! again. It walks at the droid's own walking pace, so its feet keep to the floor, and slows down
//! to turn.
//!
//! It keeps to floor it can walk: up and down stairs a step at a time, never off the edge of a
//! platform or a walkway, and where one floor is over another, on the one it is on - a point it
//! is going to is on the floor at that point's own height (see [`crate::trip`]). Where a ferry
//! gets it there sooner than walking - or there is no way round - it takes the ferry: waits for it
//! at one end, gets on as it waits, rides it across and gets off at the other end.
//!
//! They have bodies, so the player cannot walk through them, and they make way for each other.
//! One walking veers to its right round anyone ahead of it, so that two meeting head on pass
//! each other on the left, and to the left instead if a wall is in the way; one standing about
//! that sees another coming straight at it steps out of its way. Only someone right in front of
//! it stops it, and kept waiting too long, it goes somewhere else instead.
//!
//! Only those the player could see are drawn, but all of them cast their shadows, even round a
//! corner out of sight.
//!
//! Each is one of the kinds of droid in the conversations (see [`crate::dialogue`]), with a code
//! of its own, and can be talked to by a player close by and facing it. While it is, it stands
//! still and turns to face them, and afterwards stands a moment before going on its way. They
//! all start out of the player's sight, and wander - all but one, which stands a little way in
//! front of where the player starts, facing them, for a while before it sets off too.
//!
//! A conversation can turn a droid hostile (see [`Inhabitants::set_hostile`]), and a hostile
//! droid hunts the player the way Metal Gear's guards do, through its [`Alert`] phases:
//!
//! - **Alert**: it can see the player, and after a first moment runs at them, breaking into a
//!   sprint now and then (see [`SPRINT_EVERY`]), on breath spent and got back as the player's
//!   is: out of it, it walks until enough is back. A bar over its head shows how much it has
//!   left, as the player's does (see [`Inhabitants::breath`]). If it gets close enough to touch them, it
//!   has caught them.
//! - **Evasion**: it has lost them. It runs to where they were going when it last saw them, and
//!   looks about; then walks to one spot after another nearby, looking about at each, until
//!   [`EVASION`] seconds are up.
//! - **Caution**: it has given up, and wanders as before, but watching for the player still,
//!   for [`CAUTION`] seconds; then it is calm again, and can be talked to once more.
//!
//! A droid sees clearly what is in front of it, and out of the corner of its eye what is near off
//! to the side, in every phase - but nothing behind it, even right behind it: it can be crept up
//! on from behind, or slipped round (see [`Sight`]). Out of Alert it does not see as far
//! as it could: a player crouched is seen from half as far, and one crawling from less than a
//! third. With the lights off it sees a good deal less far in any phase - unless the player's
//! flashlight is on. Seeing the player again, it is back on
//! Alert, and a bolt from the pistol has it search where the shot came from.
//!
//! Out of Alert, it also listens (see [`Inhabitants::hear`]): a noise that carries as far as it
//! is, along the corridors, has it run to where the noise was and search from there.
//!
//! A sentry that sees another sentry after the player goes after them too (see
//! [`Inhabitants::join_chases`]), calm or not: the one it sees shows it where the player is. It
//! sees the other as it would see the player standing, and a sentry that sees one that has joined
//! in joins in as well, so a chase draws in every sentry that catches sight of it.
//!
//! Hostile, it cannot be talked to any more, but after [`HITS`] bolts it goes down, its eyes
//! dark: it goes limp and falls, knocked back by the last bolt, and lies where it falls (see
//! [`crate::ragdoll`]) - or, without a ragdoll, crouches. Lying there, a bolt still shoves it.
//! It stays there, for the rest of the round; the others step over it rather than round it.
//!
//! A droid that is not hostile minds having the player's pistol pointed at it (see
//! [`Inhabitants::feel_aimed_at`]): for as long as its kind stands for it, and then it stops,
//! faces the player and warns them. Each warning then holds for [`WARNING`] seconds more, time
//! to say it and for the player to take it in, before the next: the last warning, and then
//! being provoked. What it does then is up to its kind: it turns hostile, or sounds the alarm
//! (see [`Inhabitants::raise_alarm`]) for those near it that would. Looking away only holds the
//! next stage off; with the pistol off it for [`CALM`] seconds, it calms down again.
