//! A security drone, patrolling the maze. One is put down each round well away from where the
//! player starts, and hovers [`HOVER`] above the floor along the corridors, going from one spot a
//! trip away to the next and waiting a while at each - paying the player no heed, calm. More wait
//! out of sight, to be called in (see [`Drone::call_in`]): a failed hack brings one.
//!
//! It turns hostile when the alarm is sounded (see [`Drone::alarm`]) or when the player's pistol
//! hits a droid - or the drone itself (see [`Drone::shot`]). Then it goes about the player as a
//! sentry does, but by air:
//!
//! - **Searching**: it flies to where the player was and scans there, then to one spot after
//!   another nearby, scanning at each, for [`SEARCH`] seconds; and then it is calm again, and
//!   patrols as before. It sees in front of it as a sentry that is not on Alert does - less far
//!   the lower the player is, and with the lights off.
//! - **Alert**: it can see the player. It comes on to [`ENGAGE`] from them, keeps facing them and
//!   fires every [`FIRE_EVERY`] seconds while it can see them (see [`crate::drone_shot`]), each
//!   shot hurting them where it hits. Losing them, it searches.
//!
//! [`HITS`] bolts from the pistol bring it down: it sputters, its rings break into four pieces
//! each, which fly apart, and it drops with them to the floor, where it lies for the rest of the
//! round. Its body is solid, up and down: a ball the player cannot walk through, nor the droids
//! lying in the maze tumble through, nor bolts fly through, the wreck on the floor too. Flying, it
//! never pushes into anyone: someone in its way, it hovers where it is until they move.
//!
//! Its model, [`DRONE_MODEL`], is made in Blender: `drone_root`, which the animations move about,
//! with the eye, the shell and two rings under it, and the ring pieces beside it. The rings' spin
//! is in the animations, but not its glow, which is played here to go with each: what its green
//! materials glow with, over the animation's frames at 24 a second ([`glow`]); and what colour,
//! which is its mood's ([`Drone::mood`]), as a droid's eyes show theirs - its own green calm,
//! orange searching and red on Alert - turning from one to the next over a moment.
//!
//! It lights what is round it too, in its colour, as brightly as it glows: a lamp just in front
//! of its eye, whose shadows are traced as every light's are. Not inside it, where the drone's own
//! shell and eye, which are traced with the rest of the scene, would shut the light in.
//!
//! It speaks System Latin as things happen to it - hearing the alarm, spotting the player,
//! starting to search, giving up and going down - as [`DRONE_LINES`] has it, said as beeps, hums
//! and buzzes (see [`crate::formants::chirps`]), which no one would take for speech.
