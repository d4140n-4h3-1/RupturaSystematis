//! The maze comes from a model, so nothing says which parts of it are corridors. The game
//! samples the level on a grid instead: a cell is walkable when a ray dropped into it lands on the
//! floor rather than on top of a wall. Paths between cells then come from a breadth-first search,
//! which is what places the exit at the far end of the maze by walking distance, not by straight
//! line distance through the walls. The maze's inhabitants find their way about on the same grid
//! (see [`WalkGrid::routes_from`]). The grid itself is `hydroxus-ai`'s.
